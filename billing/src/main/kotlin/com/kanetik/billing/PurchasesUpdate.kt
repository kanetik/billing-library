/**
 * A single purchase update emitted by [BillingPurchaseUpdatesOwner.observePurchaseUpdates].
 *
 * Each variant carries the purchases list Play returned with the update (often empty
 * for non-success outcomes). Branch on the sealed subtype to react to each outcome:
 *
 *  - [Success] — purchases completed via the active purchase flow; acknowledge /
 *    consume them per Play's rules.
 *  - [Recovered] — `PURCHASED && !isAcknowledged` purchases discovered by the
 *    library's automatic sweep on each successful connection. Same handling as
 *    [Success] (acknowledge / consume), distinct variant so UX (confetti, "thanks!"
 *    toasts) can differentiate user-initiated purchases from background recovery.
 *    See [BillingRepositoryCreator.create][com.kanetik.billing.BillingRepositoryCreator.create]'s
 *    `recoverPurchasesOnConnect` parameter to disable.
 *  - [Pending] — purchases that completed at the protocol level but await
 *    confirmation (cash payments, deferred billing). **Do not grant entitlement
 *    yet** — wait for a matching [Success] later. See PBL's pending-purchases
 *    guidance for the full state-machine rules.
 *  - [Canceled] — user dismissed the flow.
 *  - [ItemAlreadyOwned] — non-consumable already owned; treat as already-granted.
 *  - [ItemUnavailable] — product not available (region, country, etc.).
 *  - [UnknownResponse] — anything else (raw response code in [UnknownResponse.code]).
 *
 * When a single Play callback contains both pending and settled purchases (rare —
 * Play typically delivers one per callback), the listener emits both [Success] and
 * [Pending] separately so consumers can react to each.
 *
 * ## Granting entitlement (multi-quantity)
 *
 * For consumables, always grant `purchase.quantity` units, not 1. Play supports
 * multi-quantity purchases (the Play Console flag must be enabled, and you can cap
 * via `BillingFlowParams`). The field defaults to 1 so single-unit code keeps
 * working — but ignoring it on a multi-quantity purchase silently under-grants.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Re-subscription replay
 *
 * The backing flow uses `replay = 1` so that a [Recovered] emission from the
 * auto-sweep isn't lost if the consumer's collector attaches a moment after
 * the connection comes up. The trade-off is that **the most recent emission
 * is replayed to every new subscriber**, including a subscriber that
 * re-attaches during a configuration change (`repeatOnLifecycle`, ViewModel
 * recreation, etc.).
 *
 * Handle / grant code is idempotent and absorbs this. **UI side effects are
 * not** — confetti, "thanks for your purchase!" toasts, and analytics events
 * will fire each time a re-subscribed collector receives the replayed event.
 * If you fire one-shot UX from a `Success` arm, dedupe by `purchase.purchaseToken`:
 *
 * ```
 * private val celebratedTokens = MutableStateFlow<Set<String>>(emptySet())
 *
 * billing.observePurchaseUpdates().collect { update ->
 *     when (update) {
 *         is PurchasesUpdate.Success -> update.purchases.forEach { purchase ->
 *             handle(purchase)  // safe to repeat — idempotent
 *             if (purchase.purchaseToken !in celebratedTokens.value) {
 *                 fireConfetti()
 *                 celebratedTokens.update { it + purchase.purchaseToken }
 *             }
 *         }
 *         is PurchasesUpdate.Recovered -> update.purchases.forEach(::handle)  // never fire confetti for recovery
 *         else -> {}
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Persist `celebratedTokens` (e.g. via `SavedStateHandle` or a small
 * preferences entry) if you need the dedupe to survive process death.
